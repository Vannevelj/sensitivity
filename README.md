## Contributing

Install the dependencies  
```bash
npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution
```bash
npm run all
```

Run the tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder. To generate the updated code, execute the following:

```bash
npm run all
git add .
git commit -m "Generated release files"
```

You just need to push them and manually create a new release inside Github.

## Usage:

After testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and latest V1 action
